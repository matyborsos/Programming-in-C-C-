Problem 10.1 Error messages produced by the compiler 

a) Comment out the 'using namespace std;' and then take your time, read and 
interpret the error messages.

The compiler produces a set of errors due to missing the namespace before
objects. it outputs that 'string', 'cout' and 'endl' weren't declared in the scope.
Objects 'string', 'cout' and 'endl' declared inside a namespace block are placed
in a named scope that prevents them from being mistaken for identically-named 
symbols in other scopes. Therefore we can only use these objects, that are 
defined inside of the std namespace.
We could write them as to each 'std::string', 'std::cout' and 'std::endl' found inside Critter.cpp, as
an alternative solution.

b) Also remove the Critter:: prefix in one of the methods in Critter.cpp, 
read and interpret the error message.

When I removed Critter:: before setName method the compiler produces 
an error saying that 'name' was not defined in the scope.
'name' is a private data member of the Critter class, defined in Critter.h
In this case we haven't specified the class our method belongs to,
therefore we can't access the class' other methods or data members.
We could write the method definition inside header file or 
make the data member public, as alternative solutions.
